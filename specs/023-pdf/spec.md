# Feature Specification: PDF Download Button Redesign

**Feature Branch**: `023-pdf`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "PDF„ÅÆ„ÉÄ„Ç¶„É≥„É≠„Éº„Éâ„Éú„Çø„É≥„ÅÆ‰ΩçÁΩÆ„Å®„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥„ÇíÂ§âÊõ¥„Åó„Åü„ÅÑ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "PDF„ÅÆ„ÉÄ„Ç¶„É≥„É≠„Éº„Éâ„Éú„Çø„É≥„ÅÆ‰ΩçÁΩÆ„Å®„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥„ÇíÂ§âÊõ¥„Åó„Åü„ÅÑ"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí PDF download button, position change, design change
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Position: Where should it move to?
   ‚Üí Design: What visual changes?
   ‚Üí Type: Keep as text link or change to button?
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User wants to download PDF resume
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Must change PDF link position
   ‚Üí Must update visual design
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí None (presentation layer only)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN: Multiple clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec created with clarifications needed)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want to easily find and download the PDF version of the resume through a more prominent and visually distinct element than the current text link.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing the web resume, **When** they look for the PDF download option, **Then** they should find it at the bottom of the page
2. **Given** a user sees the PDF download element, **When** they interact with it, **Then** it should appear as a button with colored background and border
3. **Given** a user clicks the PDF download element, **When** the download initiates, **Then** the correct PDF file (resume_ja.pdf or resume_en.pdf based on language) should download

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PDF file is not yet generated? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Show disabled state or hide element?]
- How does the button/link behave on mobile devices? (Centered, same size as desktop)
- Should the element remain hidden in PDF output (current behavior)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a PDF download element at the bottom of the page (after all content sections)
- **FR-002**: The PDF download element MUST be styled as a button with gray background and border (matching site theme)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to download the PDF with a single click/tap
- **FR-004**: The element MUST download the language-appropriate PDF (resume_ja.pdf for Japanese, resume_en.pdf for English)
- **FR-005**: The element MUST remain hidden when viewing/generating PDF output (maintain current behavior)
- **FR-006**: The element MUST remain centered and maintain the same size on mobile devices
- **FR-007**: The element MUST have appropriate hover/focus states for accessibility
- **FR-008**: The element MUST include a PDF icon alongside the text label

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (1 edge case remains)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (main requirements clarified)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (visual design specified)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (PDF download element only)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (maintains current PDF hiding behavior)

---

## Execution Status
*Updated by main() during processing*

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted (position, design, PDF download)
- [x] Ambiguities marked (8 clarification points)
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated (8 requirements with clarifications)
- [x] Entities identified (none - presentation only)
- [ ] Review checklist passed (needs clarifications)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Where should the PDF download element be positioned on the page? ‚Üí A: Bottom of page (like https://paulpenney.ca/resume.html)
- Q: What visual style should the PDF download element have? ‚Üí A: Button with colored background and border
- Q: Should the button include an icon? ‚Üí A: PDF icon + text
- Q: What color scheme should the button use? ‚Üí A: Gray (matching site theme)
- Q: How should the button adapt on mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Centered button (same size)

## Outstanding Clarifications

The following details still need clarification:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: What happens when PDF file is not yet generated?
   - Show disabled/grayed-out state?
   - Hide the button entirely?
   - Show with error message on click?

2. **Interaction States**: Specific requirements for:
   - Hover effects (color change, shadow, scale?)
   - Click feedback (pressed state appearance?)
   - Focus state for keyboard navigation?
