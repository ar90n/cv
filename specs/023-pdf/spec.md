**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "PDF„ÅÆ„ÉÄ„Ç¶„É≥„É≠„Éº„Éâ„Éú„Çø„É≥„ÅÆ‰ΩçÁΩÆ„Å®„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥„ÇíÂ§âÊõ¥„Åó„Åü„ÅÑ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "PDF„ÅÆ„ÉÄ„Ç¶„É≥„É≠„Éº„Éâ„Éú„Çø„É≥„ÅÆ‰ΩçÁΩÆ„Å®„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥„ÇíÂ§âÊõ¥„Åó„Åü„ÅÑ"
2. Extract key concepts from description

   ‚Üí Type: Keep as text link or change to button?
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User wants to download PDF resume
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Must change PDF link position
   ‚Üí Must update visual design
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí None (presentation layer only)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want to easily find and download the PDF version of the resume through a more prominent and visually distinct element than the current text link.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing the web resume, **When** they look for the PDF download option, **Then** they should find it in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where should the PDF button be positioned? Top-right corner? After header? Floating button?]
2. **Given** a user sees the PDF download element, **When** they interact with it, **Then** it should be visually distinct as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Button style? Icon included? Color scheme?]
3. **Given** a user clicks the PDF download element, **When** the download initiates, **Then** the correct PDF file (resume_ja.pdf or resume_en.pdf based on language) should download

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PDF file is not yet generated? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Show disabled state or hide element?]
- How does the button/link behave on mobile devices? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Fixed position? Different styling?]
- Should the element remain hidden in PDF output (current behavior)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a PDF download element in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific position - header top-right? below contact info? floating corner?]
- **FR-002**: The PDF download element MUST have [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: visual design - button with background? icon + text? specific colors?]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to download the PDF with a single click/tap
- **FR-004**: The element MUST download the language-appropriate PDF (resume_ja.pdf for Japanese, resume_en.pdf for English)
- **FR-005**: The element MUST remain hidden when viewing/generating PDF output (maintain current behavior)
- **FR-006**: The element MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: responsive behavior - how should it adapt on mobile/tablet?]
- **FR-007**: The element MUST have appropriate hover/focus states for accessibility
- **FR-008**: The element MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: include download icon? PDF icon? custom icon?]
